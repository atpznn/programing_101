TDD full name is Test Driven Development
is mean we write a test case first brfore write code or thinking about a algorithm
it have a components
first: [Red] it mean we create a test only not code or algorithm about a business logic or business function and this is why we call red becuase it always show error only when run test because don't have logic or implement function first but all test are base on a requiment or feature
second : [Green] so in this step we call green step because now i will write or create a business logic fit for all test when we run all test must be a pass all case and return a green all case if you have all pass that tell you this step is success
third : [Blue] this step we can call "refacter step" after we code has all pass now we can ensure we algorithm or function is already to use but some case code can dirty or has a smell / spagetti code so that why we should to refactor but in other case refacter is can make your afraid to fix or edit your code because your did't know after edit what result ot what happen next but in tdd we can sure and confident can edit code because we have a test cover
